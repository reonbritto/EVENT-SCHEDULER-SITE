From the 2020 show, my kids’ favorite part of last year’s show was the daring wheel-walking act performed by the ringmaster, Joseph Dominik Bauer. For those of you who like to sit on the edges of your seats, enthralled by a nail-biting experience seemingly rife with danger and catastrophe, the Wheel of Destiny going to keep you captivated. Imagine a large spinning steel wheel 20? in the air then add a real-life daredevil skipping and juggling fire on the OUTSIDE of the spinning ring. It’s a wild and unforgettable act to be sure; I watched most of it through my fingers.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, the Motorcycle Globe was part of the performance. My kids are THRILLED that it is back for 2022. Take a large metal ball – think a human-sized hamster ball – and stuff people roaring around on motorcycles inside the contraption. It’s crazy, it’s nerve-wrecking, and my kids couldn’t get enough of it.\r\n\r\nEvery year the Bangalore Creative Circus scours the globe looking for entertaining and exceptional talent to take part in their Canadian tour.
